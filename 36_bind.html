            // [Before Fixing the Code] Output:

            // [After Fixing the Code] Output: 
            // React {library: 'React', server: 'https://localhost:3000'}
                // library: "React"
                // server: "https://localhost:3000"
                // [[Prototype]]: Object
            
                console.log(`Starting the server at ${this.server}`);
        }
    }

    const app = new React();

    // Output: 
    // Button Clicked
    // Starting the server at undefined

    // Issue: We are getting undefined because the context of "this" is lost. It is pointing to the button element and not the class instance.

    // How do you know that "this" is pointing to button element?
    // In JavaScript, the value of "this" depends on the context in which a function is called. 
    // When you add an event listener using addEventListener, the function specified as the callback is executed with "this" referring to the element on which the event listener was added.
    // In Simple words:
    // The handleClick function is added as an event listener to the button element. When the button is clicked, the function handleClick is executed. 
    // In this context, "this" inside handleClick refers to the button element because "this" in event listeners refers to the element that received the event.

    // Solution: Bind

    // Bind: The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its "this" keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
